# spopzol-MH4Ultimate-Randomizer 🎲🐉

A **randomizer for Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate** that modifies multiple parameters.  
Designed to work with **Citra mods** without touching your original ROM.


## 🌱 Progress 
**Recently Completed:**
- Automatic (~100%) replace the monster and the zone in a quest. The quest is completeable, but the rewards are from the original monster.
- All areas can work with almost any monster (obvious exceptions like Dalamadur), fixed broken spawnpoints
- Some monsters have a cinematic when they enter the fight, and they need to be on their own map. 

**Next Steps:**
- Making a good Monster/Quest/Zone/IDs database
- Randomizer Logic
