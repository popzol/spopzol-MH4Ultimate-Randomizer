# spopzol-MH4Ultimate-Randomizer 🎲🐉

A **randomizer for Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate** that modifies multiple parameters.  
Designed to work with **Citra mods** or real 3DS hardware without touching your original ROM.


## 🌱 Progress 
**Recently Completed:**
- Almost Automatic (~90%) replace the monster and the zone in a quest. The quest is completeable, but the rewards are from the original monster.
- Right now, areas with cinematics only work with their respective monsters (only Fatalis in Schrade, Gogmazios in Dundorma, etc...).

**Next Steps:**
- Making a good Monster/Quest/Zone/IDs database
- 100% Automatization
- Randomizer Logic
